01_lob_basics.ipynb

Simulate random orders arriving into LOB.

Plot bid/ask spread over time.

02_hawkes_fits.ipynb

Generate order arrivals with Hawkes.

Fit exponential kernel Hawkes (via tick lib or custom).

Compare Poisson vs Hawkes arrival intensity.

03_strategy_backtest.ipynb

Implement naive market-making: post bid/ask Â± spread.

Track PnL.

Compare to random taker.
